# react-node-todo-app

A todo app that utilises NodeJS and React for the backend and front-end respectively. It uses a dummy server provided by "{JSON} Placeholder". The app has CRUD capabilities which allows for management of todo items.

# Setup
1. Clone the git repo in your local machine and start a terminal in the base folder. Run the following:
```
npm install
```
2. Once all base dependencies are installed run the following commands
```
cd api
npm start
```
This will start the server and enable communication with the API.
3. In order to run the front-end run the following command
```
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```
4. Both the front-end and the back-end should be running at this point and you should be directed to your localhost on port 3000 by React.
